- This is a solution for [the Odin Project Warmup: RestClient](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/let-s-get-building).

- It is a command line ruby program. In order to run $ ruby bing_search.rb, you would need to install ruby in your system.

- The program will ask the user what he or she wants to search in Bing, and generate the result in a html format base on the user's input.

- The purpose of making this program is to get familiar with making HTTP requests using command line and use rest-client making HTTP requests.
